### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid

### What I learned

I learned how to use git with VS code, flexbox, grid and responsive design. Also how to add Google fonts.

### Continued development

I have a lot to learn and practice. This project has been my first tiny step into frontend dev.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Trics](https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/) - This helped me understand flexbox and grid for centering. It is a very useful resourse to comeback to anytime you need. In the end I chose to center with grid - looks more clean and simple.

- [Web design tutorials](https://bringyourownlaptop.com) - This is an amazing source for design tutorials, beginer level but exactly what you need to understand building small projects in a practical way.
